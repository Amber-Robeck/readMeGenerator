# readMeGenerator

## Description

This is a project I created for school to generate a markdown file to use as a README.MD. This page is made using Node.js and does not have a deployed page.


## Here is a video of the page to show you functionality
* otherwise there are GIFS of the functionality as well

_make sure to let it load for a few seconds before playing, google drive doesn't always give the best quality at first_

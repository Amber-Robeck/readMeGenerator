# readMeGenerator

## Description

This is a project I created for school to generate a markdown file to use as a README.MD. This page is made using Node.js and does not have a deployed page. As a student I was instructed to create an application that takes in user information to create a simple readMe file. Using the inquirer module I collected user information through prompts and using the file system module I generate a markdown file using the information provided by the user. There was a develop folder provided to me with the assignment and I myself only added to the functionality to the already defined functions in the index.js and generateMarkdown.js.

## Here is a video of the page to show you functionality

- otherwise there are GIFS of the functionality as well
